## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes a **Music Store Database** using **PostgreSQL** (PgAdmin4).  
Goal: answer real-world business questions related to customers, sales, invoices, artists, and genres using SQL queries and present actionable insights.

<a id="tools--skills-used"></a>
## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills Used
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (PgAdmin4)  
- **SQL Concepts**:
  - Joins (INNER, LEFT, etc.)  
  - Aggregate Functions: `SUM`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `AVG`  
  - `GROUP BY` & `HAVING`  
  - Subqueries (scalar & IN-lists)  
  - Sorting (`ORDER BY`)  
  - Window Functions (`ROW_NUMBER()`, `PARTITION BY`)  
  - CTEs (`WITH`, including recursive when needed)

<a id="set3-q3"></a>
**Q3. Highest-spending customer per country.**

Method 1: Using MAX aggregate
```
WITH customer_spend AS (
    SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, i.billing_country,
           SUM(i.total) AS total_spending
    FROM invoice i

    GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, i.billing_country
),
country_max AS (
    SELECT billing_country, MAX(total_spending) AS max_spending
    FROM customer_spend
    GROUP BY billing_country
)
SELECT cs.billing_country, cs.customer_id, cs.first_name, cs.last_name, cs.total_spending
FROM customer_spend cs
JOIN country_max cm ON cs.billing_country = cm.billing_country
WHERE cs.total_spending = cm.max_spending
ORDER BY cs.billing_country;
```

Method 2: Using ROW_NUMBER()
```
WITH customer_spend_ranked AS (
    SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, i.billing_country,
           SUM(i.total) AS total_spending,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY i.billing_country ORDER BY SUM(i.total) DESC) AS rn
    FROM invoice i
    JOIN customer c ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, i.billing_country
)
SELECT billing_country, customer_id, first_name, last_name, total_spending
FROM customer_spend_ranked
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY billing_country;
```
